# Internet-Controlled Treat Dispenser

## What
Trigger an arduino to do something based on the value in a Google sheet.


## Why
Are you motivated by your fitness tracker to actually go out and take 10000 steps? *Me neither!*

What if you were rewarded with a treat if your previous day's step count reached 10000? That's more motivating, isn't it!

I want my tracker to trigger a device that can tempt me with treats, without me needing to do anything. It should work automatically.  


## How
You're probably wondering how do you get a signal from a tracker to an arduino. *I'm so glad you asked!*

If you have a Fitbit, you could export the data. If you have a Garmin like me, it's not so easy. Garmin doesn't let you make exports.  
I have found a 3rd party Android app that can export Garmin, somehow.
